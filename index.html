        <h2 id="goals"> Goals </h2>
        <p> Web applications are available on an ever expanding array of devices
          including e-book readers, phones, tablets, laptops, auto displays, and
          electronic signs.  There are also a variety of mechanisms that allow
          these devices to use secondary audio and video presentation devices
          available in the local environment, attached by wired connections or
          remotely with wireless, peer-to-peer media. </p>
        <p> Common attachment methods include video ports like VGA, DisplayPort
          or HDMI, or wirelessly through Miracast, WiDi, AirPlay, Bluetooth, and
          Google Cast.  Wireless presentation displays may be available on a
          local area network, or over the Internet (brokered by a cloud
          service).  In addition to displays like monitors and TVs, wireless
          speakers can serve as secondary devices for rendering Web content.
          General purpose PCs and laptops can also serve as secondary
          presentation displays. </p>
        <p> For many of these displays, the operating system hides how the
          display is attached and provides ways for native applications to
          render media on them.  Native applications can easily use additional
          presentation displays without having to know the details of the
          connection technology. </p>
        <p> The Second Screen Working Group aims at defining simple APIs that
          allow web applications to show and control web content on one or more
          presentation displays and speakers. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="scope">
        <h2 id="scope"> Scope </h2>
        <p> The scope of this Working Group is to define APIs that allow a web
          application to request display of web content on a nearby presentation
          display, with a means to communicate with and control the web content
          from the initiating page and other authorized pages. Pages may become
          authorized to control the displayed web content through explicit user
          permission, a token provided by the API, or other facilities provided
          by the user agent. </p>
        </p> The APIs will hide the details of the underlying connection
          technologies and use familiar, common APIs for messaging among
          authorized pages and the web content shown on the presentation
          display.  Web content may comprise an HTML document; parts of an HTML
          document; web media types such as images, audio, video; or
          application-specific media.  The presentation of application-specific
          media is known to the controlling page and the presentation display,
          but not necessarily to a generic HTML user agent. </p>
        <p> For a requested piece of web content, the user agent is responsible
          for determining which presentation displays are compatible with that
          content.  The API will provide the means for the web application to
          identify whether rendering the web content is likely to be successful,
          i.e. whether at least one presentation display is available that is
          capable of rendering the web content.  </p>
        <p> The API is agnostic with regard to the display technology used. The
          user agent may ask the presentation display to render the web content,
          or the user agent may render the web content itself and send the
          resulting audio and video to the presentation display using whatever
          means the operating system provides.  From the web application's point
          of view, which device is responsible for rendering the web content is
          an implementation detail. </p>
        <p> Presenting web content on a presentation display creates a
          presentation connection between the web application and the web
          content.  Web applications should be able to create multiple
          presentation connections to control web content shown on multiple
          presentation displays.  Some web content, such as HTML5 documents, can
          be controlled from multiple web applications simultaneously.
          Synchronization of web content among multiple connections may be
          possible, but is not defined by the specifications in this group.
        </p>
        <p> The specifications produced by this Working Group will include
          security and privacy considerations. Specifically, the user must
          always be in control of privacy-sensitive information that may be
          conveyed through the APIs, such as the visibility or access to
          presentation displays, or the URLs of the web content to be presented. </p>
        <p> Members of the Working Group should review other Working Groups'
          deliverables that are identified as being relevant to the Working
          Group's mission. </p>
        <h3 id="success-criteria"> Success Criteria </h3>
        <p> To advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#RecsCR">Proposed
            Recommendation</a>, each specification is expected to have two
          independent implementations of each feature defined in the
          specification. </p>
        <p> To advance to Proposed Recommendation, interoperability between the
          independent implementations should be demonstrated. Interoperable user
          agents hosting the same Presentation API web application should be
          able to render the same content with the same functionality on
          supported presentation displays that are compatible with the content to
          render. </p>
        <h3 id="out-of-scope"> Out of Scope </h3>
        <p> The specifications defined by this Working Group abstract away the
          means of connecting and different connection technologies. For
          example, the following are out of scope: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Lower level APIs that expose features of existing connection
            technologies. </li>
          <li>How presentation displays are connected to the primary device (e.g. Video
            Port, HDMI, WiDi, Miracast, AirPlay) </li>
          <li>How the user agent prepares and sends the screen contents to the
            presentation display. </li>
        </ul>
        <p> This Working Group will not mandate network protocols for sharing
          web content between user agents and presentation displays. 
          As such the following are out of scope for the Working Group:
        <ul>
          <li>Discovery of wireless presentation displays by the primary user agent</li>
          <li>Establishment of a messaging channel between the two parties,
            including message addressing, security and authentication</li>
          <li>Negotiation of a media streaming session between devices</li>
          <li>Network transport of media data</li>
        </ul>
        Instead, the network protocol to implement the Working Group APIs is
        being incubated as
        the <a href="https://webscreens.github.io/openscreenprotocol/"> Open
        Screen Protocol</a> in
        the <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/webscreens/"> Second Screen
        Community Group</a>.  The Working Group will informatively reference the
        Open Screen Protocol in its API specifications.
        </p>
        <p> Input methods, such as using a TV remote as a pointer or clicker,
          are out of scope of the Working Group. </p>
        <p> This Working Group will not define or mandate any video or audio
          codecs. </p>

        <h2 id="deliverables"> Deliverables </h2>
        <p> Draft state indicates the state of the deliverable at the time of
          the call for participation. Expected completion indicates when the
          deliverable is projected to become a Recommendation, or otherwise
          reach a stable state. </p>
        <p>
          This Working Group will follow a <a
          href="https://github.com/w3c/testing-how-to/#test-as-you-commit">test
          as you commit</a> approach to specification development, for
          specifications in CR or above.
        </p>
        <h3 id="rec-track"> Normative Specifications </h3>
        <p> The Working Group will deliver at least the following
          specifications: </p>
        <dl>
          <dt> <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/presentation-api/">Presentation
              API</a> </dt>
          <dd>
            <p> An API that allows a web application to request display of web
              content on a connected display, with a means to communicate with
              and control the web content from the initiating page and other
              authorized pages. </p>

            <p class="milestone">
              <b>Expected completion:</b> Q4 2021 &mdash; The Working Group is
              awaiting satisfaction of the <a href="#success-criteria">Success
              Criteria</a>, which require two interoperable implementations of
              the Presentation API.  The Working Group will also await
              demonstration of interoperability among multiple browsers and
              multiple presentation displays before moving the specification to
              Proposed Recommendation.
            </p>

            <p>
              The <a href="https://github.com/webscreens/openscreenprotocol">
              Open Screen Protocol</a>, under incubation in
              the <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/webscreens/"> Second
              Screen Community Group</a>, will be the basis for demonstrating
              interoperability between browsers and devices.  Two
              implementations based on it would satisfy those criteria. The
              charter timeline provides additional time for Open Screen Protocol
              implementations to be completed and the Success Criteria to be
              met.
            </p>
            <p>
              A second version of the Presentation API that integrates features
              the Working Group resolved not to include in the first version in
              the interest of time, and also feedback from Web developers on the
              first version, will first be incubated and matured in an
              appropriate Community Group. This Working Group expects to bring
              such features out of incubation through rechartering, when the
              criteria for moving the current Presentation API to Proposed
              Recommendation have been met.
            </p>

            <p>
              Additional features will be considered for the Presentation API to
              align it with the work on the Open Screen Protocol, based on
              implementation experience with that protocol.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additional features will also be considered to improve
              compatibility with the Remote Playback API and presentation of
              additional media types that are supported by the Open Screen
              Protocol.

              A comprehensive test suite for all features of a specification is
              necessary to assess the specification's robustness, consistency, and
              implementability, and to promote interoperability between user
              agents. Therefore, each specification must have a companion test
              suite, which should be completed before transition to Candidate
              Recommendation, and which must be completed with an implementation
              report before transition to Proposed Recommendation. Additional
              tests may be added to the test suite at any stage of the
              Recommendation track, and the maintenance of an implementation
              report is encouraged.

              Additionally, this Working Group will improve test automation for

              will be done through the adoption of a Testing API, incubated in
              an appropriate Community Group. The Testing API will also allow
              developers to use automation to test their own Web applications
              that make use of the above-mentioned APIs.

        <p> The initial draft of the Presentation API was prepared by the
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/webscreens/">Second
            Screen Community Group</a>. Upon approval of the Working Group, the
          Community Group ceased its work on the Presentation API
          specification. The Community Group is currently focused on incubating
          the <a href="https://github.com/webscreens/openscreenprotocol">Open
          Screen Protocol</a>, an open set of network protocols that includes
          authentication and security mechanisms, for the APIs defined in this
          Working Group. The
          Community Group may also work on other related deliverables where it
          is not clear enough how to proceed for it to be a work item for a
          Working Group. The Community Group is only one possible source for
          work under future Working Group charters, but can serve to do initial
          exploration for some future work items. </p>
        <p> The specifications produced by this Working Group adhere to the
          web's security model defined in the HTML specification published by
          the Web Platform Working Group. </p>
        <p> Common web technologies that this Working Group could refer to for
          messaging include Web Messaging and the Web Socket API defined by the

          <p> To be successful, the Second Screen Working Group is expected to
            have 6 or more active participants for its duration, and to have
            the participation of industry leaders in fields relevant to the
            specifications it produces. </p>
          <p> The Chairs and specification Editors are expected to contribute
            half a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no
            minimum requirement for other Participants. This Working Group will
            also allocate the necessary resources for building Test Suites for
            each specification. </p>
          <p> The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical
            submissions for consideration, with the agreement from each
            participant to Royalty-Free licensing of those submissions under the
            W3C Patent Policy. </p>

          <h2 id="communication"> Communication </h2>
          <p> Teleconferences will be conducted on an as-needed basis. </p>
          <p> This group primarily conducts its work on the public mailing list
            <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-secondscreen/">public-secondscreen@w3.org</a>.
            Administrative tasks may be conducted in Member-only communications.

          <p> Information about the group (deliverables, participants,
            face-to-face meetings, teleconferences, etc.) is available from the

          <h2 id="decisions"> Decision Policy </h2>
          <p>
            This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due
            process, per the
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#Consensus">W3C
            Process Document (section 3.3)</a>. Typically, an editor or other
            participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in
            discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and
            consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but
            consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range
            of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and
            record a decision along with any objections.
          </p>
          <p>
            To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation,
            any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a
            face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered
            provisional.
          </p>
          <p>
            A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for
            example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period
            from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's
            evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.
          </p>
          <p>
            If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the
            response period, the resolution will be considered to have
            consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
          </p>
          <p>
            All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved
            unless and until new information becomes available, or unless
            reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
