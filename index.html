        <h2 id="goals"> Goals </h2>
        <p> Web applications are available on an ever expanding array of devices
          including e-book readers, phones, tablets, laptops, auto displays, and
          electronic signs.  A variety of mechanisms allow
          these devices to use secondary audio and video presentation devices
          available in the local environment, attached by wired connections or
          remotely with wireless, peer-to-peer media. </p>
        <p> Common attachment methods include video ports like VGA, DisplayPort
          or HDMI, or via wireless protocols such as  Miracast, WiDi, AirPlay, Bluetooth, and
          Google Cast.  Wireless presentation displays may be available on a
          local area network, or over the Internet (brokered by a cloud
          service).  In addition to displays like monitors and TVs, wireless
          speakers can serve as secondary devices for rendering Web content.
          General purpose PCs and laptops can also serve as secondary
          presentation displays. </p>
        <p> For many of these displays, the operating system hides how the
          display is attached and provides ways for native applications to
          render media on them.  Native applications can easily use additional
          presentation displays without having to know the details of the
          connection technology. </p>
        <p> The Second Screen Working Group aims at defining simple APIs and an
          open suite of network protocols (specified as an application of
          existing IETF protocols) that allow web applications to present
          and control web content on one or more presentation displays and
          speakers. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="scope">
        <h2 id="scope"> Scope </h2>
        <p> The scope of this Working Group is to define:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>APIs that allow a web
          application to request display of web content on a nearby presentation
          display, with a means to communicate with and control the web content
          from the initiating page and other authorized pages;</li>
          <li>A suite of network protocols that allow user agents to implement
          the APIs in an interoperable fashion for browsers and presentation
          displays connected via the same local area network.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Pages may become authorized to control the displayed web content
          through explicit user permission, a token provided by the API, or
          other facilities provided by the user agent. The APIs will hide the
          details of the underlying connection
          technologies and use familiar, common APIs for messaging among
          authorized pages and the web content shown on the presentation
          display.  Web content may comprise an HTML document; parts of an HTML
          document; web media types such as images, audio, video; or
          application-specific media.  The presentation of application-specific
          media is known to the controlling user agent and the presentation display,
          but not necessarily to a generic HTML user agent. </p>
        <p> For a requested piece of web content, the user agent is responsible
          for determining which presentation displays are compatible with that
          content.  The API will provide the means for the web application to
          identify whether rendering the web content is likely to be successful,
          i.e. whether at least one presentation display is available that is
          capable of rendering the web content.  </p>
        <p> The API is agnostic with regard to the display technology used. The
          user agent may ask the presentation display to render the web content,
          or the user agent may render the web content itself and send the
          resulting audio and video to the presentation display using whatever
          means the operating system provides.  From the web application's point
          of view, which device is responsible for rendering the web content is
          an implementation detail. </p>
        <p> Presenting web content on a presentation display creates a
          presentation connection between the web application and the web
          content.  Web applications should be able to create multiple
          presentation connections to control web content shown on multiple
          presentation displays.  Some web content, such as HTML5 documents, can
          be controlled from multiple web applications simultaneously.
          Synchronization of web content among multiple connections may be
          possible, but is not defined by the specifications in this group.
        </p>
        <p> The suite of network protocols will cover required steps for two
          user agents to implement the APIs: discovery, authentication,
          transport, and messaging (including API control messages and messages
          for streaming media between agents). The suite will reuse and
          configure existing IETF protocols for each of these steps. This
          Working Group will work with the IETF to assess whether parts of the
          protocol suite may apply to broader scenarios than the ones envisioned
          for the APIs. If that is the case, those parts may be further
          developed in the IETF. </p>
        <p> This Working Group will not mandate network protocols for sharing
          web content between user agents and presentation displays. The APIs
          will informatively reference the protocol suite. </p>
        <p> The specifications produced by this Working Group will include
          security and privacy considerations. In particular, the user must
          always be in control of privacy-sensitive information that may be
          conveyed through the APIs, such as the visibility or access to
          presentation displays, or the URLs of the web content to be presented. </p>
        <p> Members of the Working Group should review other Working Groups'
          deliverables that are identified as being relevant to the Working
          Group's mission. </p>
        <h3 id="out-of-scope"> Out of Scope </h3>
        <p> The specifications defined by this Working Group abstract away the
          means of connecting and different connection technologies. For
          example, the following are out of scope: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Lower level APIs that expose features of existing connection
            technologies;</li>
          <li>How presentation displays are connected to the primary device (e.g. Video
            Port, HDMI, WiDi, Miracast, AirPlay);</li>
          <li>How the user agent prepares and sends the screen contents to the
            presentation display.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> This Working Group will reuse and configure existing network
          protocols to create an open suite of network protocols suitable for
          the APIs. As such, the following are out of scope for the Working
          Group: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Any new feature in existing IETF protocols normatively referenced
            by the suite of network protocols;</li>
          <li>Any new protocol for discovery, authentication, transport and
            messaging;</li>
          <li>Any protocol not required to implement the APIs developed by this
            Working Group.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Input methods, such as using a TV remote as a pointer or clicker,
          are out of scope of the Working Group. </p>
        <p> This Working Group will not define or mandate any video or audio
          codecs. </p>

              Open Screen Protocol</a> will be the basis for demonstrating
              interoperability between browsers and devices.  Two
              implementations based on it would satisfy those criteria. The
              charter timeline provides additional time for Open Screen Protocol
              implementations to be completed and the Success Criteria to be
              met.

              A second version of the Presentation API that integrates features
              the Working Group resolved not to include in the first version in
              the interest of time, and also feedback from Web developers on the
              first version, will first be incubated and matured in an
              appropriate Community Group. This Working Group expects to bring
              such features out of incubation through rechartering, when the
              criteria for moving the current Presentation API to Proposed
              Recommendation have been met.
            </p>

            <p>
              Additional features will be considered for the Presentation API to

              A comprehensive test suite for all features of a specification is
              necessary to assess the specification's robustness, consistency, and
              implementability, and to promote interoperability between user
              agents. Therefore, each specification must have a companion test
              suite, which should be completed before transition to Candidate
              Recommendation, and which must be completed with an implementation
              report before transition to Proposed Recommendation. Additional
              tests may be added to the test suite at any stage of the
              Recommendation track, and the maintenance of an implementation
              report is encouraged.

              will be done through the adoption of a Testing API, incubated in
              an appropriate Community Group. The Testing API will also allow
              developers to use automation to test their own Web applications
              that make use of the above-mentioned APIs.

        <h2> Success Criteria </h2>
        <p> To advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#RecsCR">Proposed
            Recommendation</a>, each specification is expected to have two
          independent implementations of each feature defined in the
          specification. </p>
        <p> To advance to Proposed Recommendation, interoperability between the
          independent implementations should be demonstrated. Interoperable user
          agents hosting the same Presentation API web application should be
          able to render the same content with the same functionality on
          supported presentation displays that are compatible with the content to
          render. </p>
        <p> The specifications produced by this Working Group will include
          security and privacy considerations. Specifically, the user must
          always be in control of privacy-sensitive information that may be
          conveyed through the APIs, such as the visibility or access to
          presentation displays, or the URLs of the web content to be presented.
          Specifications should also avoid unnecessary or severe increases to
          fingerprinting surface, especially for
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/fingerprinting-guidance/#dfn-passive-fingerprinting">passive
          fingerprinting</a>.</p>

        <p> The initial drafts of the Presentation API and of the Open Screen
          Protocol were prepared by the
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/webscreens/">Second
            Screen Community Group</a>. Upon approval of the Working Group, the
          Community Group ceased its work on the Presentation API and the core
          Open Screen Protocol specifications.
          The Community Group may work on other related deliverables where it
          is not clear enough how to proceed for it to be a work item for a
          Working Group, including on extensions to the Open Screen Protocol.
          The Community Group is only one possible source for
          work under future Working Group charters, but can serve to do initial
          exploration for some future work items. </p>
        <p> The specifications produced by this Working Group adhere to the
          web's origin-based security model. </p>
        <p> Common web technologies that this Working Group could refer to for
          messaging include Web Messaging and the Web Socket API. </p>
        <p> No external dependencies against the specifications of this Working
          Group have been identified. </p>
        <h3 id="liaisons"> Liaisons </h3>

        with the <a title="Technical Architecture Group"
        href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/">TAG</a>. Invitation for review must

            the participation of industry leaders in fields relevant to the
            specifications it produces. </p>
          <p> The Chairs and specification Editors are expected to contribute
            half a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no
            minimum requirement for other Participants. This Working Group will
            also allocate the necessary resources for building Test Suites for
            each specification. </p>
          <p> The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical
            submissions for consideration, with the agreement from each

          <p> Teleconferences will be conducted on an as-needed basis. </p>
          <p> This group primarily conducts its technical work on GitHub. The

            <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-secondscreen/">public-secondscreen@w3.org</a>
            is used for calls for consensus. Administrative tasks may be

          <h2 id="decisions"> Decision Policy </h2>
          <p>
            This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due
            process, per the
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#Consensus">W3C
            Process Document (section 3.3)</a>. Typically, an editor or other
            participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in
            discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and
            consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but
            consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range
            of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and
            record a decision along with any objections.
          </p>
          <p>
            To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation,
            any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a
            face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered
            provisional.
          </p>
          <p>
            A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for
            example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period
            from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's
            evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.
          </p>
          <p>
            If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the
            response period, the resolution will be considered to have
            consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
          </p>
          <p>
            All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved
            unless and until new information becomes available, or unless
            reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
