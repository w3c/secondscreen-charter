          Background

        <p>
          Web applications are available on an ever expanding array of devices including e-book
          readers, phones, tablets, laptops, auto displays, and electronic signs. A variety of
          mechanisms allow these devices to use secondary audio and video presentation devices
          available in the local environment, attached by wired connections or remotely with
          wireless, peer-to-peer media.
        </p>
        <p>
          Common attachment methods include video ports like VGA, DisplayPort or HDMI, or via
          wireless protocols such as Miracast, WiDi, AirPlay, Bluetooth, and Google Cast. Networked
          presentation displays may be available on a local area network or over the Internet. In
          addition to displays like monitors and TVs, wireless speakers can serve as secondary
          devices for rendering Web content. (For the purposes of this charter, "presentation
          displays" includes wireless speakers as well.) General purpose PCs and laptops can also
          serve as secondary presentation displays.
        </p>
        <p>
          For many of these displays, the operating system hides how the display is attached and
          provides ways for native applications to render media on them. Native applications can
          easily use additional presentation displays without having to know the details of the
          connection technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Second Screen Working Group aims at defining simple APIs for presenting content on
          presentation displays, and an open suite of network protocols (specified as an
          application of existing IETF protocols) that allow web applications to present and
          control web content on networked presentation displays and speakers.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>
          Scope
        </h2>
        <p>
          The scope of this Working Group is to define:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>APIs that allow a web application to request display of web content on presentation
          displays, with a means to communicate with and control the web content from the
          initiating page and other authorized pages;
          </li>
          <li>A suite of network protocols that allow user agents to implement the APIs in an
          interoperable fashion for browsers and presentation displays connected via the same local
          area network.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Pages may be authorized to use a presentation display and control the displayed web
          content through explicit user permission, a token provided by the API, or other
          facilities provided by the user agent. The APIs will hide the details of the underlying
          connection technologies and use familiar, common APIs for communication among authorized
          pages and the web content shown on the presentation display. Web content may comprise an
          HTML document; parts of an HTML document; web media types such as images, audio, video;
          or application-specific media. The presentation of application-specific media is known to
          the controlling user agent and the presentation display, but not necessarily to a generic
          HTML user agent.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a requested piece of web content, the user agent will provide the means for the web
          application to identify whether rendering the web content on a networked presentation
          display is likely to be successful, i.e. whether a presentation display is available that
          is capable of rendering the web content.
        </p>
        <p>
          The APIs are agnostic with regard to the display technology used. The user agent may ask
          the presentation display itself to render the web content, or the user agent may render
          the web content itself and send the resulting audio and video to the presentation display
          using whatever means the operating system provides. From the web application's point of
          view, the connection technology used to convey the results of rendering the web content
          is an implementation detail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Presenting web content on a networked presentation display creates a presentation
          connection between the web application and the web content. Web applications should be
          able to create multiple presentation connections to control web content shown on multiple
          networked presentation displays. Some web content, such as HTML documents, can be
          controlled from multiple web applications simultaneously. Synchronization of web content
          among multiple connections may be possible, but is not defined by the specifications in
          this group.
        </p>
        <p>
          To allow the interoperable use of networked presentation displays, the suite of network
          protocols will cover required steps for two user agents to implement APIs to use
          networked displays: discovery, authentication, transport, and messaging (including API
          control messages and messages for streaming media between agents). The suite will reuse
          and configure existing IETF protocols for each of these steps. This Working Group will
          work with the IETF to assess whether parts of the protocol suite may apply to broader
          scenarios than the ones envisioned for the APIs. If that is the case, those parts may be
          further developed in the IETF.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Working Group will not mandate network protocols for sharing web content between
          user agents and presentation displays. The APIs will informatively reference the protocol
          suite.
        </p>
        <p>
          The specifications produced by this Working Group will include security and privacy
          considerations. In particular, the user must always be in control of privacy-sensitive
          information that may be conveyed through the APIs, such as the visibility or access to
          presentation displays, or the URLs of the web content to be presented.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scope of this Working Group is to also define APIs that allow scripts to query the
          device for information about connected displays and to position windows relative to those
          displays.
        </p>
        <p>
          Operating systems generally allow users to connect multiple displays to a single device
          and arrange them virtually to extend the overall visual workspace. A variety of
          applications use platform tools to place windows in such multi-display environments, but
          web application developers are limited by existing APIs, which were generally designed
          around the use of a single display.
        </p>
        <p>
          The APIs in scope will allow web applications to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>detect if the device has more than one connected display,
          </li>
          <li>detect when connected displays are added, removed, or reconfigured,
          </li>
          <li>request display information required to facilitate window placement across displays,
          </li>
          <li>show elements fullscreen on a specific display, and place windows on a specific
          display.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Members of the Working Group should review other Working Groups' deliverables that are
          identified as being relevant to the Working Group's mission.

            Out of Scope
          </h3>
          <p>
            The specifications defined by this Working Group abstract away the means of connecting
            and different connection technologies. For example, the following are out of scope:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Lower level APIs that expose features of existing connection technologies;
            </li>
            <li>How presentation displays are connected to the primary device (e.g. Video Port,
            HDMI, WiDi, Miracast, AirPlay);
            </li>
            <li>How the user agent prepares and sends the screen contents to the presentation
            display.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This Working Group will reuse and configure existing network protocols to create an
            open suite of network protocols suitable for the APIs. As such, the following are out
            of scope for the Working Group:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Any new feature in existing IETF protocols normatively referenced by the suite of
            network protocols;
            </li>
            <li>Any new protocol for discovery, authentication, transport and messaging;
            </li>
            <li>Any protocol not required to implement the APIs developed by this Working Group.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Input methods, such as using a TV remote as a pointer or clicker, are out of scope of
            the Working Group.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Working Group will not define or mandate any video or audio codecs.

                The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/openscreenprotocol/">Open Screen Protocol</a>
                will be the basis for demonstrating interoperability between browsers and devices.
                Two implementations based on it would satisfy those criteria. The charter timeline
                provides additional time for Open Screen Protocol implementations to be completed
                and the Success Criteria to be met.

              <p>
                A second version of the Presentation API that integrates features the Working Group
                resolved not to include in the first version in the interest of time, and also
                feedback from Web developers on the first version, will first be incubated and
                matured in an appropriate Community Group. This Working Group expects to bring such
                features out of incubation through rechartering, when the criteria for moving the
                current Presentation API to Proposed Recommendation have been met.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additional features will be considered for the Presentation API to align it with
                the work on the Open Screen Protocol, based on implementation experience with that
                protocol.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additional features will also be considered to improve compatibility with the
                Remote Playback API and presentation of additional media types that are supported

                A comprehensive test suite for all features of a specification is necessary to
                assess the specification's robustness, consistency, and implementability, and to
                promote interoperability between user agents. Therefore, each specification must
                have a companion test suite, which should be completed before transition to
                Candidate Recommendation, and which must be completed with an implementation report
                before transition to Proposed Recommendation. Additional tests may be added to the
                test suite at any stage of the Recommendation track, and the maintenance of an
                implementation report is encouraged.

                Additionally, this Working Group will improve test automation for the Presentation
                API and Remote Playback API test suites. This will be done through the adoption of
                a Testing API, incubated in an appropriate Community Group. The Testing API will
                also allow developers to use automation to test their own Web applications that
                make use of the above-mentioned APIs.

          expected to have <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two
          independent implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification, where
          interoperability can be verified by passing open test suites, and two or more
          implementations interoperating with each other. In order to advance to Proposed
          Recommendation, each normative specification must have an open test suite of every
          feature defined in the specification. Interoperable user agents hosting the same
          Presentation API web application should be able to render the same content with the same
          functionality on supported presentation displays that are compatible with the content to
          render.
        </p>
        <p>
          There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.
        </p>
        <p>
          To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications should have <a href=

          conducted via the <a href="https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt">Web Platform
          Tests</a> project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each specification should contain sections detailing all known security and privacy
          implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users. Specifically, the user must
          always be in control of privacy-sensitive information that may be conveyed through the
          APIs, such as the visibility or access to presentation displays, or the URLs of the web
          content to be presented. Specifications should minimize and mitigate their <a href=

          surfaces</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits
          and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and
          recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations.

            While the Presentation API does not have a direct dependency on any given set of
            protocols, the following is a tentative list of external bodies the Working Group
            should collaborate with to develop the Open Screen Protocol and allow the Presentation
            API and Remote Playback API to be implemented on top of widely deployed attachment
            methods for networked presentation displays:

          To be successful, the Second Screen Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active
          participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of
          this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs,
          specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day
          per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other
          Participants.

          This group primarily conducts its technical work on <a id="public-github" href=

        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at

          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section
          5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial
          proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other
          reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved
          after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a
          group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>

        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution
          (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will
          be considered provisional. A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions
          (for example, via email, GitHub issue and/or web-based survey), with a response period
          from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group
          consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised by the end of the response period,
          the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new
          information becomes available, or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs.
